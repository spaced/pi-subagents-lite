# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Agent state publication.** The manager publishes an `AgentStateSnapshot` (per-agent id, type, status, live context-usage percent) on the shared `pi.events` bus under the `pi-subagents-lite:state` channel on every subagent assistant message, for cross-extension consumers.
- **Explicit per-call model override is preserved.** Passing `model` to the Agent tool no longer gets overwritten by the agent's configured/default model; the override is also surfaced in the spawn display (cherry-picked from Atif Mustaffa's fork).

### Fixed

- **Subagent spawns inherit the parent session's project trust.** A spawn without a `worktree_path` (and a same-repo worktree target) was always treated as trusted, so in a project whose trust the user declined, the subagent's resource loader still imported the project's `.pi/extensions`, skills, and settings — resources pi's own session refuses to load. Omitted paths now use `ctx.isProjectTrusted()`, and same-repo targets use the saved trust decision for the target path when one exists, falling back to the parent's state; an explicit saved decision still wins. Cross-repo gating is unchanged.
- **A failed agent start no longer leaks its concurrency slot.** When `startAgent` threw after reserving a slot (e.g. the output-transcript file could not be created), neither the spawn nor the queue-drain failure path released the reservation, permanently lowering that model's effective concurrency. The reservation is now released on every pre-run failure.
- **Spawn wizard no longer silently drops a spawn when agent discovery fails.** An unreadable worktree `.pi/agents/` directory made the promise chain swallow the error: the menu closed with no spawn and no message. The wizard now warns and proceeds with the spawn the user asked for.
- **Queued agents no longer offer a Steer action.** `manager.steer` always rejects a queued agent (it has no session yet); the action is now offered only while running.
- **Widget navigation (↓) works with always-visible overlay extensions present.** `isEditorFocused()` keyed off `tui.hasOverlay()`, which is true for *any* visible overlay — so an always-visible, non-focus-taking overlay (e.g. a user's rail extension) permanently reported the editor as unfocused and the ↓ key could never activate agent navigation. The check now keys off the focused component only: an overlay that takes focus (viewer, model picker) unfocuses the editor, while an unfocused overlay leaves it focused.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Extension tool aliases accept `extension/all` as well as `extension/*`.** Both forms include or exclude all tools from the named extension.
- **New config setting `loadToolsImplicitly` (default ON, `/agents` > System Prompt).** When frontmatter omits the tool fields, ON makes the Subagent behave like a normal session: pi's `defaultTools` applies unchanged and inactive tools stay registered for dispatcher tools. OFF starts it with no tools. Explicit frontmatter always wins.

### Changed

- **Child sessions load pi's built-in extensions** (codemode, tool-search, mcp; llama.cpp excluded). They are addressable by bare name (`codemode`) from `defaultTools`, settings `extensions`, and frontmatter `extensions`/`exclude_extensions`, exactly as in a normal session. Requires pi >= 0.99.0.
- **A silent agent config no longer snapshots `defaultTools` into a registry allowlist.** pi owns tool fallbacks, so dispatcher tools can reach inactive and late-registered tools.

### Fixed

- **Extension tool aliases use the owning package name.** Package extension entries under paths like `src/index.ts` now resolve to their declared package name instead of `src`.
- **No more child-session leaks.** Every child session terminates through one idempotent disposal (abort, `session_shutdown`, dispose) — whether it settles, stops, is cleared, outlives its record, or fails during setup — releasing built-in extension resources exactly once.

## [1.15.1] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Responses token injection preserves ChatGPT sign-in compatibility.** The subagent output-limit hook now overrides pi's existing `max_output_tokens` but doesn't restore the field when pi omitted it for Sign in with ChatGPT credentials.
- **Context percentage respects its own widget visibility setting.** It remains visible when input and output token counts are hidden.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **The conversation viewer no longer shows tool results.** Each tool call renders as a single status-colored line (tool name + args summary, pending → success/error background); result content never renders, inline under a call or as a standalone result block. Thinking, assistant text, steering, stop, and scrolling are unchanged, as is the parent chat's Agent tool display and the text the model receives.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- **`Agent`, `StopAgent`, and `AgentStatus` registered with `description: "."`**. Some gateways rejected description-less tools.

### Added

- **Opt-in agent descriptions in the Agent tool schema.** A new `agent.exposeDescriptions` setting (default `false`) makes the `Agent` tool's `agent` parameter description list each visible agent's name together with its Markdown description (`Available agent types:` followed by one `name: description` line), so SDK/RPC/print-mode hosts get routing-relevant information at the decision point without any TUI interaction. Empty descriptions degrade to the bare agent name and hidden agents stay excluded. Default behavior (name-only, minimal tokens) is unchanged; the value is read when the tool registers, so toggling it takes effect on the next session. Toggle lives in Agent settings > Tools ("Expose agent descriptions").

### Changed

- **AgentStatus no longer requests constrained sampling.** Its empty, closed parameter schema remains unchanged, while providers are free to handle the status call without strict JSON schema mode.
- **Subagents respect pi's per-model thinking level setting.** A `modelThinkingLevels` entry in pi's settings.json (keyed `provider/modelId`, project layer over global) now participates in subagent thinking resolution at the position above the `defaultThinking` setting: explicit spawn param > agent frontmatter `thinking` > pi's per-model level for the resolved model > `defaultThinking` > pi's own fallback (`defaultThinkingLevel` setting, then medium, clamped to the model's supported levels). Previously the per-model level was ignored everywhere: `defaultThinking` silently overrode it, and session creation never consulted it. The Model settings menu, the spawn wizard, and the Agent tool call display show the same spawn-effective chain. The wizard's thinking value is now a Derived/UserSet state: it shows the level the spawn will actually run with and re-derives when you switch the model, while any explicit pick (including Inherit) is kept across model switches and only clamped to the new model. `defaultThinking` keeps its purpose — overriding pi's global default — but no longer overrides an explicit per-model choice.
- **`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` floor raised to `>=0.84.3`.** The per-model thinking setting and its `SettingsManager` accessors shipped in pi 0.84.3, so the per-model read calls the accessor directly instead of degrading through raw settings reads for older versions. Lockfile regenerated through npm.

### Fixed

- **Conversation viewer no longer loses streamed content at block boundaries.** While watching a subagent run, each completed streaming block (thinking, then response text) vanished the moment the next block started and only reappeared when a tool result landed minutes later. pi's agent loop replaces the last messages-array slot on every streaming delta, so the viewer's per-index render cache — keyed on array reference, count, and width — never went stale while a message streamed and stayed frozen at its first, near-empty snapshot; the streaming accumulators, the only other copy, are cleared at each `*_end`. The viewer now re-renders the in-flight message's cache entry from the session transcript synchronously at exactly the accumulator-clearing boundaries (`thinking_start`/`thinking_end`/`text_start`/`text_end`) and at the session-level `message_end` (pi's final-message slot swap), where the finished block exists only in the transcript — so it can never duplicate the live streaming suffix. Completed text stays on screen the moment it completes, content shown is never retroactively changed when the tool result re-renders the message, and the debounced streaming render cadence, ctrl+T thinking visibility (with the "Thinking..." label while hidden), tool-result inlining, and scroll behavior are unchanged.
- **Restart last agents obeys the project-trust gate.** Restarting agents from session history skipped every check the live Agent tool applies to `worktree_path`: the historical path was neither validated nor trust-resolved, the target project's `.pi/agents` types loaded unconditionally, and the spawn runner treated the target as trusted (`projectTrusted` defaulted to true) — so a restart into an untrusted cross-repo worktree ran with that project's agent types and settings, contradicting the warning live spawns surface. Each historical call now resolves through the same shared spawn-target computation as a live spawn: the path is validated (an invalid one is reported in the skipped list with the self-correctable error), cross-repo trust is resolved, the explicit `projectTrusted` decision is forwarded to the runner, untrusted targets' `.pi/agents` types stay hidden, and the untrusted-project warning reaches the user through the same shared notify policy as live spawns. Calls without a `worktree_path` are unaffected, and a malformed one (a non-string value from history or a tool call) counts as omitted exactly as the live tool treats it instead of failing with a TypeError; restarted agents now also show the target's worktree label in the widget like live spawns.
- **Agent tool call thinking injection obeys the project-trust gate.** The pre-execution injection read pi's `modelThinkingLevels` at the spawn target through an ungated `SettingsManager`, so an untrusted cross-repo `worktree_path` target's settings file could set the spawn's thinking level — the injected value runs as the explicit param, above every configured source, while pi's trust warning says the project's `.pi/` settings are ignored. The listener now resolves the spawn target exactly as execution does (validation plus the same trust decision, silently, without duplicate warnings) and skips the per-model term for untrusted targets; the runner's own trust-gated read still decides. The read also now uses the validated target path instead of the raw tool argument.
- **Spawn wizard no longer passes its derived thinking level as an explicit override.** The Derived display value is a prediction read at the parent cwd; passing it as the explicit param shadowed a worktree target's own per-model entry and pi's per-model fallback. In the Derived state the wizard now spawns with nothing — frontmatter, per-model, and defaultThinking are exactly the runner's chain, resolved at the actual target cwd — and re-reads the pi settings snapshot when the selected worktree changes, so the displayed level keeps tracking the spawn target. A user-chosen level (including Inherit) is still passed as chosen.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- **Running Agents menu shows readable durations.** Each row now shows a formatted run duration (`5m 37s`, `1h 1m 1s`) instead of a raw second count. Finished rows freeze the duration at completion and append how long ago the run settled (`... — my task 2m ago`).
- **Schemas migrated to pi's `typebox` 1.x line, declared as a peer dependency.** Tool parameter schemas and config validation now build on the unscoped `typebox` package instead of `@sinclair/typebox` 0.34 — a package the pi host does not ship, so the extension and host previously maintained different schema libraries. `typebox` (>= 1.3.7) joins the three pi packages as a peer: pi's extension loader aliases it to the host's own copy in every runtime mode, dev/CI gets it via npm peer auto-install (lockfile-pinned), and the extension ships no schema-library copy at all. Emitted schemas are unchanged JSON data; the full suite passes without behavior changes.
- **Dev dependency on pi dropped; the peer declaration is the single contract.** The `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` devDependency entry is removed — npm provides the package in dev/CI by auto-installing the existing peer dependency (`>=0.82.0`), so typecheck and tests are unchanged while the version floor is declared once instead of twice. The lockfile keeps pinning the resolved version. Dev-only: no impact on the published package.

### Fixed

- **Manual spawn runs in background by default.** The spawn wizard Background toggle now defaults to ON, so the parent session gets the result via nudge. Foreground menu spawns had no tool return to deliver through, so their result never reached the main session.
- **Tool count marker renders reliably across terminal fonts.** Replaced the forced text-presentation emoji with a one-cell text symbol, avoiding the Unicode replacement glyph when that text variant is unavailable.
- **Subagent output-limit injection follows pi's per-API algorithm.** When an agent sets `max_tokens`, the injected provider field is now resolved exactly the way pi resolves it for the model's API — `max_output_tokens` on OpenAI Responses APIs, nested fields on bedrock, Google, mistral, and pi-messages, pi's compat-chain field on openai-completions, and none on Codex — and it is re-resolved per request, so a mid-run model change stays in sync with pi. Previously the extension sent a top-level `max_tokens` field whenever the model's compat was silent, which those providers ignore or reject, so the author's cap silently dropped. Models on unknown future APIs keep the previous `max_tokens` injection.
- **Config files validate on load.** Every value in the global and project config files is checked against a runtime schema at load. A wrong-typed value is dropped from the effective config (built-in defaults apply), valid keys are kept, the file on disk is left unchanged, and one warning per bad value names the file, the key, what was got, what was expected, and how to fix it in the `/agents` menu or by editing or deleting the file. Fork-shaped object model values are dropped with a warning, never migrated, and a bad value can no longer crash the load with an unhandled error.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **Agent `color` frontmatter.** Agent `.md` files can set `color: <named-color>` or `color: #RRGGBB` in frontmatter. The agent's status icon is tinted with that color across all UI surfaces, including widget connector lines and a new toggle in General settings.
- **Background agent status indicators.** When an agent is scheduled to run in the background, the UI now clearly shows its status in the call-line icon: `◆` (accent) when queued, `◈` (accent) when running, `✓` (success) when completed or turn-limited, `✗` (error) on error or abort, and `■` (dim) when stopped; foreground call lines show `▸`. The result line shows the model tag and stats for finished foreground agents and the description only for background agents (icon lives in the call line). Live status updates via invalidation map — the icon flips as the agent progresses.
- **Model picker prioritizes configured models.** The model picker (via `/model`, model settings, concurrency settings, and spawn wizard) now shows models sorted: current model first, then models from `subagents-lite.json` agent config (default + per-type overrides), then all remaining models. This makes configured models easy to find without searching. Search/filter still works correctly with the new sort order.

### Changed

- **Flattened settings menu.** Reworked setting menu into 5 top-level categories for easier navigation.
- **Unified agent status icons across all UI surfaces.** Tool call lines, the subagent status widget, and the conversation viewer now share one status→icon map (`statusIcon` in `format.ts`): `◆` queued, `◈` running, `✓` completed (success), `✓` turn-limited (warning), `✗` error/aborted, `■` stopped (dim), `▸` when no status yet.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Restart last agents from debug menu.** A new "Restart last agents" command in the debug menu finds the most recent Agent tool call(s) in session history and replays them, spawning fresh agents with the same configuration. Useful when agents are cancelled by mistake or lost after reload. Running agents are skipped. Uses current config model (not historical) and spawns as background for steer support.
- **Limit-bounded AgentStatus output.** The AgentStatus tool now always lists in-progress agents (running, queued) and then shows settled agents (completed, turn_limited, aborted, stopped, error) most-recently-settled first, capped at `agentStatusLimit` settled agents; when settled agents are hidden, the output ends with "and N more settled agents". The new `agentStatusLimit` config key (Widget settings > Behavior, numeric entry) defaults to 0 = auto: 2 × the configured default concurrency (8 at the built-in default of 4), so the cap scales with how many agents can run at once. Records are unaffected — the limit only changes what the tool prints.
- **ext/none syntax suppresses extension warning.** Agent tool configs can now use `ext/none` in the tools list to explicitly register zero extension tools, suppressing the warning about missing extensions. Previously `tools: []` meant zero built-in tools but extensions were still warned about; `ext/none` now makes the intent explicit.

### Changed

- **No explicit `any` type usage remains in test code.** `typecheck` already covered `test/`; every explicit `any` annotation across the test suite is now replaced with the real `src/` or pi-package type, or with a structural fake asserted at a single call boundary. Type-level only: all 1592 tests behave identically.
- **Test `any` regression gate.** `npm run test:any-gate` scans `test/` for explicit `any` annotations and fails if any are found (whitelisting the two documented load-bearing sites and `expect.any(...)` vitest matchers). Import specifiers in test files unified to `.js` (no `.ts` extensions in import paths).
- **Typed test context helpers.** `fakeCtx()` and `createMockCtx()` in `test/fixtures.ts` now return properly typed `ExtensionContext` / `ExtensionCommandContext` with typed defaults and an options parameter for overrides, eliminating the two documented `any` return annotations.
- **`subscribeToSessionEvents` annotation corrected.** The function's parameter type now references `RunCallbacks` (the interface that defines the callback keys) instead of `RunOptions` (which carries extra fields the function never reads). Purely defensive; no call sites changed.
- **TypeScript 7 toolchain and test typechecking.** The development toolchain now uses TypeScript 7.0.2 (the native compiler, `tsc`); the package swap is behavior-neutral for the extension itself. `npm run typecheck` now covers `test/` as well as `src/` (tests were previously transpiled by vitest but never typechecked); the type errors this surfaced were fixed in test code only (stale mock typings, fixtures, and imports), with no change to extension behavior.
- **Subagents honor pi's `defaultTools` setting.** Agent types without explicit tool config now use pi's `defaultTools` (global `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` + project `.pi/settings.json`) as their registered built-in tool set. Unconfigured keeps the hardcoded `read`/`bash`/`edit`/`write` set, explicit `[]` means zero built-in tools, and explicit agent tool config (whitelist, `exclude_tools`, `tools: false`, read-only sets) still wins. Extension tools remain always-enabled. On pi < 0.84.2 the setting is honored via the merged-settings read; only the `getDefaultTools` API is missing (pi ≤ 0.84.1 lacks the accessor — 0.84.2 ships it — so the read feature-detects and falls back to the merged settings field).
- **Model settings grouped by resolved model.** Per-type overrides are grouped alphabetically by the model they resolve to; each row shows the spawn-effective (clamped) thinking level and the winning layer's tag (`[session]`/`[project]`, global-won rows untagged). Only explicit per-type overrides are listed; frontmatter-only and inheriting types stay hidden (hint arrows gone). The session default is a session-wide override that beats config per-type overrides and frontmatter models. Concurrency settings share the style: rows set targets inline with a nested Clear, section headers in bold accent, and clear/remove pickers offer only the levels that carry the setting ("All levels" only when at least two do), and `j`/`k` navigate list submenus.
- **Debug menu shows each agent type's effective tool set.** The Agent types listing and the Agent briefing now display the tools an agent actually gets: the explicit `registeredTools` when configured, otherwise pi's `defaultTools` setting, otherwise the hardcoded `read`/`bash`/`edit`/`write` set. The generic "all built-in tools" placeholder is gone, the briefing always includes a Tools line, and an explicitly empty set renders as `(none)`. The menu reads `defaultTools` through the same version-tolerant accessor as the spawn path, so the two displays and the session gate cannot diverge. `tools: []` in an agent config now means zero built-in tools everywhere — no consumer silently falls back to the default set.

### Fixed

- **Agent tool error display shows ✗ instead of ✓.** Agent and StopAgent tools now throw on errors instead of returning `errorResult()`, matching how built-in tools (bash, edit, read, write) handle errors. Agent-loop's catch block sets `isError: true`, so the renderResult callbacks use `context?.isError` (from the agent-loop's correct error flag) instead of `result.isError`, which is absent from the production data flow. Failed tool calls now correctly display a red cross (✗) and error background color.
- **nanoid bumped to 3.3.18.** The dev-only transitive dependency (via postcss) is now locked at 3.3.18, clearing the high-severity `npm audit` finding for nanoid's zero-size generator loop (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8). No runtime or extension behavior change.
- **Agents status line stays visible for the session.** The status line's visibility is now: after the last agent finishes and its row ages out, the line keeps showing the session done count and cost in its dimmed form, and it hides only when no agent records exist.
- **Git-root discovery during skill loading is constant-time per ancestor level.** `findGitRoot` now probes `.git` with a single `existsSync` per level instead of reading the full directory listing
- **Tool-argument summaries truncate with the ellipsis character.** Long single string arguments to arbitrary tools now end with `…` (U+2026) like bash commands, instead of three ASCII dots.
- **Write-tool summaries show the real file path.** `summarizeToolArgs` now reads the `path` argument key that pi's write tool actually sends, so summaries render as `write("/path/to/file", N chars)` instead of `write("", N chars)`.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Parent interrupt forwarding.** Foreground subagents are now bound to the parent's interrupt signal. Stopping the parent stops all foreground children. Background agents are not affected.
- **Project-level config.** `.pi/subagents-lite.json` in a trusted project is an override layer over the global `~/.pi/agent/subagents-lite.json`: it may hold only model and concurrency settings, and each key it sets overrides the global value; clearing a project value falls back to global. `/agents` menu changes now pick a write target — session, global, or project — and persist only that level's keys; the merged config is never written to a file. Unknown keys in a hand-edited project file are ignored with a warning; a malformed project file is ignored and the project level is not offered. Loaded only in trusted projects, same as `.pi/agents`.
- **Agent menu clear actions.** Individual `Clear` action removes a settled agent. `Clear all`/`Clear done` bulk-removes all/done agents from the widget.
- **Time-based finished retention.** Replaced turn-based eviction with a configurable time window. Finished agents stay visible for `finishedRetentionMinutes` (default 1 min) instead of a fixed number of turns.
- **Transient transport error retry.** Brief stream failures (ECONNRESET, EPIPE, ETIMEDOUT, EAI_AGAIN) are retried automatically instead of failing the run.
- **Continue settled agents.** `steer()` now resumes a settled agent (completed, errored, aborted, stopped, turn-limited) that still has a live session, instead of requiring a re-spawn. The viewer footer/composer switches from "steer" to "continue" for settled agents.
- **Per-agent context and prompt inclusion.** New `include_context_files` and `include_system_prompt` frontmatter fields on agent definition files override the global settings per agent: whether AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md context files load as `<project_context>`, and whether the parent's system prompt is included (inherit, replace, or global mode).
- **Stop notes for never-started agents.** Agents stopped before they started (queued stop, aborted spawn) now report that the task was NOT attempted instead of claiming partial output. Applies to tool results and background nudges.

### Removed

- **`effectiveDefault` from the model-groups builder result.** `buildModelGroups` no longer computes or returns an `effectiveDefault` field: no production code consumed it (the menu derives the default row from the config snapshot's own `default` key), and it duplicated the menu's local `effectiveDefault` under a different meaning. The `ModelGroups` interface and its tests no longer reference it.
- **`deltaInputTokens` setting and delta estimation.** Removed the vLLM-specific workaround that estimated input token deltas by subtracting consecutive `usage.input` values.

### Changed

- **Running Agents menu bulk actions grouped.** The stop row sits above the clear-actions group.
- **Case-insensitive agent type resolution.** The `Agent` tool's `agent` parameter now resolves type names case-insensitively: the exact registered name wins; a single case-insensitive match resolves; two types differing only by case produce an error naming both candidates instead of a silent pick, and nothing spawns. Applies to the initial lookup, the mid-session re-scan, and worktree-targeted spawns.

### Fixed

- **Model settings per-type provenance tag.** When the session default shadows a project key, the per-type row now shows `[session]` (the value's true source) instead of a misleading `[project]`.
- **Spawn options menu refreshes after a change.** Setting or clearing any spawn option now rebuilds the row immediately, so "Default max turns" and "Default thinking level" show their new value and `[project]` tag without reopening the menu.
- **Default concurrency limit removable per target.** The "Default concurrency limit" row now offers Edit limit / Remove limit like the per-provider and per-model rows, so the value can be cleared at the chosen level (session, global, project, or all) and fall through to the next layer.
- **Default max turns clearable per target.** The "Default max turns" row's target picker now offers "Clear...", leading to a nested per-level picker (global, project, or all levels) so the value can be removed at a chosen level and fall through to the next layer, instead of requiring an empty submission.
- **Model settings "Set globally" label aligned.** The entry now reads "Set globally (saves to config)", matching the target picker's "saves to" phrasing.
- **Target-picker wording.** The global and project entries now read "Global (saves to config)" / "Project (saves to project config)", parallel with "Session (not saved)".

- **"(inherits parent)" no longer stored as a model value.** In the Model Settings menu, picking "(inherits parent)" now deletes the key at the chosen level (session, global, or project) instead of persisting the literal sentinel string into the config file or session overrides; the effective model falls through to the next layer.
- **"All levels" clears never create a project file.** Clearing a model or concurrency key at all levels in a trusted project without `.pi/subagents-lite.json` previously wrote an empty project file out of nothing. A clear now skips the project layer entirely when no project file exists (only a set creates the file); an existing project file keeps today's behavior.

- **Conversation viewer freeze from running agents menu.** Viewer overlay now uses `{ overlay: true }` so closing it restores the menu instead of clobbering it and freezing all input.
- **View result bottom border.** Fixed mirrored corner characters in the text viewer frame.
- **Running Agents menu skips separator rows.**
  Up/down navigation no longer lands on the blank separator rows between the agent list and the bulk actions; the cursor jumps from the last agent straight to the first bulk action row. The separator-skip mechanism is now a shared helper used by both the settings-menu wrapper and the Running Agents menu.
- **`defaultMaxTurns` fallback in tool execution path.** Prevents failures when max turns is not explicitly set.
- **Stale concurrency slots cleaned up.** Removing a concurrency limit from config now frees the orphaned slots in-session.
- **`outputThinkingBufferSize` changes apply live.** The thinking-buffer size is now read from the config store at run time, so changing the setting takes effect without restarting pi.
- **Rejected abort/steer promises swallowed.** Session abort and steer calls no longer throw unhandled rejections when the session is already closed.
- **Qwen quota retry.** Qwen `insufficient_quota` errors containing "Allocated quota exceeded" are retried instead of failing immediately. These may be transient false positives when the quota check is eventually consistent.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **Respect pi's `hideThinkingBlock` setting.** Conversation viewer now honors the parent's thinking block visibility setting.

### Changed

- **Widget layout.** Activity expands to remaining width.
- **Compact mode layout.** Activity and description expands to remaining width.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **`outputTranscript` setting.** Global config option and `output_transcript` frontmatter field disable per-agent `.output` transcript writing; agent-level setting overrides global. Spawn Options menu includes toggle.
- **Model/thinking placement setting.** Controls where model name and thinking level appear in the widget: `header`, `metadata`, or `none`. Defaults to `metadata` in full mode, `header` in compact.
- **CI automation for GitHub releases.** Pushing a version tag now automatically creates a GitHub release.

### Changed

- **Migrated from Bun to npm.** Project now uses npm for package management; lockfile is `package-lock.json`.
- **Default changes.** `modelDisplayStyle` now defaults to `name`; `finishedRetentionMinutes` defaults to 1 (was 10); `outputTranscript` defaults to `false`.
- **`finishedRetentionMinutes` setting accepts decimals.** decimal values are allowed.

### Fixed

- **ConversationViewer cache invalidated on message replacement.** Ensures stale conversation state doesn't persist when messages array is replaced.
- **Model/thinking placement defaults aligned.** Internal defaults now match user-visible defaults.
- **Output-file streaming survives session compaction.** File output continues correctly after session compaction events.
- **Widget block height matches rendered lines.** `getBlockHeight` now accounts for metadata line presence.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Watchdog for stuck agents.** Detects agents stuck in long tool calls or idle states and stops them automatically. Configurable timeouts: `watchdogToolTimeoutMinutes` (default 45) and `watchdogIdleTimeoutMinutes` (default 45). Surface in widget, results, and nudges.
- **Scroll-viewport navigation.** Widget navigation now tracks a scroll window that follows the highlighted agent, keeping the selected row visible when the roster overflows the available space.
- **Identity-based nav highlight with deferred rerank.** Navigation highlight now tracks agent IDs instead of positional indexes, so the highlight survives roster reordering between renders.
- **Tool and idle timeout entries in Spawn Options menu.** Configure watchdog timeouts per-agent at spawn time.
- **Optional background completion hiding.** Widget Behavior settings can hide background-agent completion cards from the TUI; results remain available to the model and Running agents. Thanks [@michalriha1](https://github.com/michalriha1).

### Changed

- **`navHint` setting now respected during active navigation.** The nav hint in the widget heading shows only when not actively navigating.
- **Widget navigation refactored.** `navUp`/`navDown` merged into `moveNav`, nav state extraction unified behind `resolveNavState`, and rendering split into focused methods.
- **Subagents without explicit tool config default to pi's active set (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`)** instead of all built-ins; `grep`/`find`/`ls` must be whitelisted in `tools:` to activate.

### Fixed

- **Non-numeric input rejected in numeric menu items.** Prevents entry of invalid characters in timeout and other number fields.
- **ctrl+o shortcut detection uses `matchesKey`.** Supports all terminal input formats instead of raw character matching.
- **Hidden agents now display their configured `display_name`.** Previously, hidden agents showed "Agent" instead of their frontmatter `display_name` when spawned.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- **Transient Codex stream error retry.** Brief stream failures (ECONNRESET, EPIPE, ETIMEDOUT, EAI_AGAIN) are now retried automatically instead of failing the run.
- **Cross-repo `worktree_path` targets.** `worktree_path` accepts a path inside any git repository on disk: a linked worktree of the parent's repo, its main checkout, or a different repo. Paths outside any git repo are rejected.

### Changed

- **Cross-repo spawns gated by project trust.** Spawning into a different git repo loads the target's project resources only when pi's trust decision (nearest ancestor) or the global `defaultProjectTrust` setting allows it. An untrusted target still spawns, but its resources (`.pi/` settings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, system prompt files, `.agents/skills`) are ignored, `.pi/agents` types are not discovered, and a warning is surfaced. Same-repo paths are never gated.

### Fixed

- **Git path normalization on Windows.** Worktree paths use backslash separators on Windows so `git rev-parse` resolves correctly.
- **Newlines sanitized in error messages.** Prevents TUI layout breakage when error text contains `\n` or `\r` characters.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **`showTools` and `deltaInputTokens` now default to off.** Reduces noise in the widget and spawn wizard for new users.

### Fixed

- **`defaultThinking` from spawn options now applied in LLM-driven spawn path.** Subagents spawned via the `Agent` tool now respect the thinking level set in spawn options when agent frontmatter does not define one. Previously they inherited the parent's thinking level instead.
- **Error message included in background agent failure nudge.** The completion nudge for a failed background subagent now appends the error text so the parent sees why the agent failed without opening the output file.
- **Subagent model errors surfaced as failed runs.** When a subagent's model fails (load error, OOM, provider error), the run is now reported as an error instead of silently completing with an empty result.
- **Agent self-stop distinguished from user stop in status notes.** Agent-initiated stops now read 'STOPPED BY YOU' matching the user stop style.
- **CRLF line endings parsed in agent frontmatter.** Agent files with Windows line endings (`\r\n`) are now parsed correctly. Previously the closing delimiter was not recognized and the agent was silently dropped.
- **Model picker uses `ctx.scopedModels` for pi 0.83+.** Model list respects provider-scoped model availability.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- **`statusBarFormat` setting** (`'full' | 'compact'`). Full format (default) always shows active and done counts. Compact: `◈ N MΣ`.
- **Model and thinking indicators in widget.** `(modelName · thinkingLevel)` shown next to agent names. `modelDisplayStyle` toggles between short ID and full name. Independent visibility toggles in widget settings.
- **Model-aware thinking level filtering in spawn wizard.** Levels filtered by selected model's capabilities. Model change clamps current level.
- **`agentToolStrictMode` toggle.** Constrained sampling with strict json_schema for the Agent tool. Reduces malformed tool calls at higher token cost.
- **Thinking level in nudge cards.** Shown alongside model name.
- **Project agent dirs gated behind `isProjectTrusted()`.** Untrusted projects skip `.agents/agents` and `.pi/agents`. User-level agents always load.

### Changed

- **Widget settings reorganized into 4 submenus.** Layout, Display, Behavior, Stats.
- **DONE line shows token count, not cost.** `getLifetimeTotal()` returns input + output only.
- **Stats labels drop `Show` prefix.**

### Fixed

- **Spawn wizard display refreshes** after model or thinking level change.
- **Thinking level displayed in widget** when using default (inherit) thinking level.
- **Failed agent starts no longer count** toward `totalAgentCount` or `totalAgentCost`.
- **`setShowModel`/`setShowThinking` now sync stats visibility** to the widget immediately.
- **Home directory resolution on Windows.** Replaced `process.env.HOME` with `getAgentDir()` from SDK.
- **Text emoji for tools count** in spawn options.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Configurable turn-based eviction for finished agents.** Widget evicts agents after a configurable number of idle turns (default 4). Gated behind `finishedEvictTurns` setting.
- **`finishedRetentionMinutes` setting** (Widget Settings, default 10, min 1). Controls how long finished agents stay visible.
- **Navigation highlight clamps** when roster shrinks from agent eviction.
- **`max` in spawn menu.** Max thinking level now selectable in the spawn wizard.

### Changed

- **Finished agents no longer vanish mid-navigation.** Widget eviction unified with manager retention.
- **Agent tool result message clearer.** Delegation confirmation now explicitly states the agent was spawned.

### Fixed

- **Turn eviction timing corrected.** Eviction now triggers on `turn_start` instead of `tool_execution_start`, preventing incorrect eviction.
- **Widget error containment.** Render, timer, and turn errors are caught and logged instead of crashing the widget.
- **Extension tools available to subagent sessions.** Tools registered by extensions now pass through to subagent sessions correctly.
- **Nav breakage after eviction fixed.** Roster navigation stays consistent when agents are evicted.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **Extension tools no longer missing from subagent sessions.** `createAgentSession({ tools })` is a registry allowlist gate in pi; a builtins-only list silently filtered out every extension tool before registration. Fix: expand `tavily/*` and bare extension tool names in the whitelist _before_ session creation so they enter the gate. `resolveSessionAllowedTools` (new, in `agent-types.ts`) owns this policy; in whitelist mode the gate derives from the expansion alone (no raw wildcards, no unlisted builtins leak). `tools: undefined` agents register all loaded extension tools consistent with pi's own `includeAllExtensionTools` semantics.
- **Whitelist no longer leaks unlisted builtins into the registry gate.** A secondary bug where `registeredTools` was used as an unconditional base alongside the whitelist. Under strict semantics, builtins not named in `tools:` do not enter the allowlist, and raw wildcard literals like `"tavily/*"` never reach pi as bogus tool names.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Shared workspace agent discovery.** Agents from `.agents/agents/*.md` are now discovered alongside `.pi/agents/`. Precedence: default < user < shared < project.
- **ConversationViewer replaces ResultViewer.** Full conversation transcript with live streaming, thinking blocks, tool args (4000 char limit), success/error icons, compaction summaries, and event-driven updates (no polling). Navigation: arrow keys, vim j/k, g/G, Home/End, f fullscreen, r refresh. Steering via Enter when agent running.
- **Constrained tool sampling with strict json_schema.** Provider-side schema validation reduces malformed tool calls. Graceful fallback on unsupported providers.

### Changed

- **Agent status icons replaced with ◈/◇.** Broader terminal-font coverage than ●/○.
- **Peer dependencies updated to pi 0.82.** `@earendil-works/pi-*` peers now resolve to ^0.82.0.

### Fixed

- **Widget timer survives steer re-registration.** `clearWidget` no longer kills the timer when steer re-registers the tool.
- **ConversationViewer scroll boundary.** Scroll max computed from actual content, not stale cache.
- **Streaming deduplication.** No duplicate text when full message event catches up to streamed deltas.
- **`bun.lock` peerDep carets restored.** Lock file peer dependencies use carets for flexible resolution.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **`thinking: max` level support.** Import `ThinkingLevel` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` so the `max` thinking level is available alongside `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`.

### Fixed

- **Removed deprecated `modelRegistry` from `createAgentSession`.** Compatible with pi 0.80+ which replaced `modelRegistry` with `modelRuntime`.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **Cleanup timer preserves unconsumed agent records.** Background cleanup no longer evicts records before the LLM has read their results.

## [1.4.7] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Delta input token tracking for vLLM models.** Shows input token delta in the widget for models without cache stats. Opt-in, off by default.

### Fixed

- **User vs agent stops distinguished in status notes.** `StopAgent` tracks stop initiator, surfacing different notes in result output.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`deltaInputTokens` widget setting.** Toggle input token delta display for models without cache reporting.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Thinking buffer flush rounded to sentence boundaries.** Log file thinking content flushes at natural sentence breaks.

### Fixed

- **Nudge delivery fixed with fresh pi instance.** `SpawnCoordinator` stores the pi instance for nudge delivery, preventing stale context crashes.
- **Fallback to UI notification when nudge delivery fails.** Completion notifications surface even if `sendMessage` fails.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **Nudge messages use correct `deliverAs` mode.** Prevents delivery failures when parent session state has changed.
- **Stale context error suppressed on background agent nudge.** No spurious errors when nudging agents whose parent context was replaced.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Thinking buffer ring selector in widget settings.** Configure how many lines of thinking content appear in the widget tail.
- **Agent display format flipped to `id (type)`.** Resolves `StopAgent` ambiguity when multiple agents of the same type are running.
- **Thinking blocks streamed to output file in real-time.** Thinking content written as it arrives, with deduplication when `thinking_end` fires.

### Fixed

- **Stale pi context crash in SpawnCoordinator nudge emission.** Uses current pi instance instead of captured reference.
- **Worktree validation warnings flushed via `ctx.ui.notify`.** Errors surface to the user instead of silently failing.
- **KV cache ordering improved.** `active_agent` tag moved after shared prefix; `AGENTS.md` placed before `agent_instructions`.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Search in type, provider, model, and worktree selection menus.** Incremental text search across all spawn wizard and settings menus.
- **Live descriptions in SettingsList menus.** Contextual descriptions replace the Back button.

### Fixed

- **Notify calls buffered during setup.** Prevents session tree corruption when extensions call `notify()` before initialization.
- **Inline YAML array syntax parsed correctly.** `[a, b, c]` bracket notation strips brackets in frontmatter parsing.
- **System prompt menu rebuilds when switching modes.** Custom/inherit/replace changes update the submenu immediately.
- **Pi scaffolding stripped from parent prompt in all modes.** Inherit mode no longer duplicates pi's system prompt wrappers.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **`disableDefaultAgents` setting.** Hide built-in agents so only custom `.pi/agents/*.md` agents are advertised.
- **Status notes for non-normal agent outcomes.** Stopped, aborted, and turn-limited agents carry explicit notes for the orchestrator.
- **KV cache optimization.** System prompt reordered for maximum cache reuse across agents.

### Changed

- **Menus unified to pi-style SettingsList/SelectList.** All menus use pi's native components with consistent navigation and submenus.
- **`steered` status renamed to `turn_limited`.** More accurate naming for agents that wrapped up at their turn budget.

### Fixed

- **Disabled agents no longer advertised in tool description.** `enabled: false` agents filtered from the LLM's type list.
- **Agent tool type list built after settings load.** Description reflects persisted settings.

## [1.3.0] and earlier

AgentStatus tool, `worktree_path` parameter, manual spawn menu, cost display, compact mode sync, configurable grace turns, selective extension loading, skill whitelisting, and the foundational subagent spawning system with foreground/background modes, concurrency limits, and the `/agents` menu.
