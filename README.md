Sub-agents for [pi](https://pi.dev). Schema-first, minimal token overhead.

Spawn custom agents in isolated session with own tools, extensions and model. Three tools with one-dot descriptions — the least strict OpenAI-tools gateways accept. Names like `Agent`, `run_in_background`, and `worktree_path` are the schema.

Foreground and background agents with detailed model configuration, concurrency, custom agent types, steering and continuation, cross-repo worktree support, configurable system prompt modes, a live widget and conversation viewer with cost tracking, and a watchdog for stuck agents.

## Differences from upstream

Fork of [AlexParamonov/pi-subagents-lite](https://github.com/AlexParamonov/pi-subagents-lite) (remote `upstream`), rebased onto v1.16.0 — child sessions resolve tools exactly like a normal pi session (`loadToolsImplicitly`), load pi's built-in extensions, and terminate through one idempotent disposal path. The lite design drops pi-vault's scheduling, join modes, and chains.

On top of upstream:

- **Caller-defined model and thinking level.** The `Agent` tool accepts `model` and `thinking` params; an explicit per-call `model` is preserved rather than overwritten by the agent's configured/default model (cherry-picked from Atif Mustaffa's fork).
- **Subagent spawns inherit the parent session's project trust.** A spawn without an explicit trust decision uses the parent session's own state, so it never loads project resources the parent is running without. A failed start releases its concurrency slot, the spawn wizard warns and proceeds when worktree agent discovery fails, and queued agents no longer offer a Steer action (cherry-picked from Bjorn Nordblom's fork).
- **Agent state publication.** The manager publishes an `AgentStateSnapshot` (per-agent id, type, status, live context-usage percent) on the shared `pi.events` bus under the `pi-subagents-lite:state` channel, for cross-extension consumers.

## Install

Requires Node.js >= 18 and pi >= 0.82.0.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-subagents-lite
pi install -l npm:pi-subagents-lite   # project-local
pi -e npm:pi-subagents-lite           # try without installing
```

## Usage

The LLM calls `Agent` like any other tool. Foreground agents return inline with stats. Background agents acknowledge immediately and auto-deliver on completion.

```

The widget shows running and recently finished agents above the editor. `↓`/`↑` highlights an agent, `Enter` opens the conversation viewer, `Esc` closes navigation. The viewer streams the live transcript — thinking blocks, tool calls, and compaction summaries. Tool results are not shown: each call appears as a single status-colored line (pending → success/error).

The `/agents` menu covers running agents (view, steer, continue settled agents, stop, clear), manual spawns without an LLM round-trip, model settings, concurrency, and widget layout.

### Agent tools

- `Agent` spawns a sub-agent (see [Agent options](#agent-options) for parameters).
- `StopAgent` stops a running or queued agent by ID. IDs come from the spawn result, the stop error, or `/agents`.
- `AgentStatus` lists all agents with type, short ID, and status.

Foreground agents dont lock the session and can be stopped by parent's interrupt. Background agents are fully autonomous.

### Steering and continuation

Steer a running agent mid-task to redirect it: `Enter` in the conversation viewer, or `Steer` in the `/agents` menu. Settled agents (completed, errored, stopped, turn-limited) can be continued manually from the conversation viewer.

## Built-in agents

- `general-purpose` does general task execution using the configured session tools.
- `Explore` does read-only codebase exploration.

Built-ins can be overridden by custom agents or disabled from `/agents`. Disabling takes effect immediately for future `Agent` calls. Running and queued agents continue with the policy captured at spawn.

## Custom agents

Drop a `.md` file into `.pi/agents/` (project), `.agents/agents/` (shared), or `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (global). Frontmatter configures the agent, the body is its system prompt. The name auto-populates the `agent` parameter's enum, so nothing needs registering. On name clash, project > shared > user > built-in. Type names resolve case-insensitively.

```markdown
---
name: security-review
description: Review code for security issues
tools: [read, bash, grep]
extensions: false
skills: false
model: zai/glm-5.2
thinking: high
max_turns: 80

```

A minimal agent with just `name` and `description` gets everything, same as `general-purpose`. Set restrictions only when you want them.

### Frontmatter reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | — | Agent type name. Must be unique; a file without it is skipped. |
| `display_name` | string | `name` | Label in the UI. |
| `color` | string | none | Agent color for icon tinting. Named colors: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `purple`, `orange`, `pink`, `cyan`. Palette aliases: `amber`, `teal`, `indigo`, `gold`, `violet`, `rose`, `lime`, `gray`, `slate`, `navy`, etc. Also accepts `#RRGGBB` hex. |
| `description` | string | `""` | One-sentence description. |
| `tools` | `true` \| `string[]` \| `false` | `true` | Tool whitelist. Mutually exclusive with `exclude_tools`. |
| `exclude_tools` | `string[]` | none | Tool blacklist. Mutually exclusive with `tools`. |
| `extensions` | `true` \| `string[]` \| `false` | `true` | Which extensions load (hooks and commands). Does not control tool visibility. |
| `exclude_extensions` | `string[]` | none | Extension blacklist. |
| `skills` | `true` \| `string[]` \| `false` | `true` | Skill whitelist (metadata-only in system prompt). |
| `preload_skills` | `string[]` \| `false` | `false` | Dump full SKILL.md content into the system prompt. Expensive. |
| `model` | string | inherit parent | `"provider/model-id"`. See [Model resolution](#model-resolution). |
| `thinking` | string | inherit parent | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. |
| `max_turns` | number | unlimited | Soft turn limit, then grace turns before hard abort. |
| `max_tokens` | number | unlimited | Max output tokens per LLM response. |
| `hidden` | boolean | `false` | Hide from the enum. Still callable by name. |
| `output_transcript` | boolean | inherit global | Write streaming transcript to `/tmp/pi-agent-outputs/<agentId>.log` (frontmatter overrides). |
| `include_context_files` | boolean | inherit global | Include AGENTS.md files as `<project_context>` in the system prompt. `true` = load, `false` = none, unset = global "Include AGENTS.md" setting. |
| `include_system_prompt` | boolean | inherit global | Include the parent's system prompt for this agent. `true` = inherit parent, `false` = replace mode, unset = global mode. When the global mode is `custom`, the custom prompt wins over `true`. |

When frontmatter omits `tools` and the agent type carries no explicit registered-tools set, `loadToolsImplicitly` (config, default ON) decides: ON delegates tool setup to pi, so your `defaultTools` setting applies exactly as in a normal session, and tools left inactive stay registered for dispatcher tools to call by name. OFF starts such agents with no tools. Explicit frontmatter always wins.

`tools` and `exclude_tools` accept built-in names (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`) and extension tool names (`web_search`). Use `tavily/*` or `tavily/all` in either list to include or exclude all tools from that extension. Excluding tools doesn't prevent the extension from loading; use `exclude_extensions: [tavily]` to prevent loading.

`loadSkillsImplicitly`, `loadExtensionsImplicitly`, and `loadToolsImplicitly` (config, default ON) decide what an agent gets when frontmatter omits `skills`, `extensions`, or the tool fields. Turn one OFF to default new agents to nothing on that axis and opt in explicitly.

Built-in extensions: child sessions load pi's built-in codemode, tool-search, and mcp extensions (llama.cpp excluded), addressed by bare name (`codemode`) from `defaultTools`, settings `extensions`, and frontmatter, exactly as in a normal session. A user extension registering the same tool, command, or flag replaces the built-in.

Codemode in Subagents needs two things: the codemode extension loaded, and the codemode tool activated. With default settings one line does both, in `.pi/settings.json`:

```json
{ "defaultTools": ["+codemode"] }
```

Every agent whose frontmatter omits `tools` then starts with codemode active, exactly like your main session. Agents with an explicit `tools` list ignore `defaultTools`: add `codemode` to that list to activate it. If `loadExtensionsImplicitly` is off, agents also need `extensions: codemode` in frontmatter to load the extension.

## Agent options

`Agent` accepts:

- `prompt` (required) is the task text.
- `description` is a short label for the widget; defaults to the first line of the prompt.
- `agent` is the agent type; defaults to `general-purpose`.
- `run_in_background` makes the agent return immediately and notify the parent when complete.
- `worktree_path` is any git repository on disk: a worktree of the parent's repo, its main checkout, or a different repo entirely. See [Worktree paths and trust](#worktree-paths-and-trust).

`model`, `thinking`, `max_turns`, and `max_tokens` are injected from config and frontmatter, never passed by the LLM. Set them once and forget.

Subagents cannot spawn further subagents.

### Worktree paths and trust

`worktree_path` accepts a path inside any git repository on disk: a linked worktree of the parent's repo, its main checkout, or a different repo entirely. The subagent runs with that directory as its working directory. A path outside any git repo is rejected.

Project resources follow pi's trust decisions. Cross-repo targets are gated by pi's existing trust framework: the target's saved trust decision (nearest ancestor wins) applies, and an undecided target falls back to the global `defaultProjectTrust` setting. Anything other than "always" means untrusted. Same-repo targets (a worktree of the parent's repo, or an omitted `worktree_path`) follow the parent session's own trust state when the trust store has no explicit decision for the target path, so a subagent never loads project resources the parent session is running without. An untrusted target still spawns, but its project resources (`.pi/` settings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, system prompt files, `.agents/skills`) are ignored, its `.pi/agents` types are not discovered, the extension's project config (`.pi/subagents-lite.json`) is not loaded, and pi surfaces a warning. The `/agents` spawn wizard still lists same-repo worktrees only.

## Model resolution

Precedence, highest first:

1. Session per-type override (`/agents` > Model settings)
2. Session global default
3. Config per-type override (`~/.pi/agent/subagents-lite.json`)
4. Config global default
5. Agent frontmatter `model`
6. Parent model

## Concurrency

`concurrency` caps parallel agents. A per-model limit overrides a per-provider limit, which overrides the `default` per-model limit. Excess spawns queue until a slot frees.

## Settings

Global settings live in `~/.pi/agent/subagents-lite.json`, managed via `/agents` or edited directly. 

`/agents` covers model settings per-type overrides, concurrency, widget, spawn defaults (thinking, max turns, force-background), system prompt mode, watchdog timeouts.

```
Settings

→ Model                           Set global default and per-type model overrides
  Concurrency                     Set per-model slot limits
  Agent                           Agent limit, colors, output, thinking
  System prompt                   Prompt mode, AGENTS.md, skills, extensions
  Widget                          Configure widget display options
```

Widget is higly customizable as the rest of the extension

### Project-level config

A project can commit its own defaults as `.pi/subagents-lite.json` (same file name as the global one). This is an override layer, not a full config. It may contain only model and concurrency settings (`agent.default`, per-type model overrides, `concurrency`), and each key it sets overrides the global file's value. Every other setting (widget, watchdog, spawn defaults) always comes from the global file. The effective value of each key resolves as: session override > project file > global file > built-in default.

### System prompt mode

`systemPromptMode` (default `replace`):

- `replace` uses a minimal generic prompt plus the agent's instructions. Lowest cost and most isolated.
- `inherit` uses the parent's system prompt plus the agent's instructions.
- `custom` uses `~/.pi/agent/subagents-lite-prompt.md` plus the agent's instructions.

When `includeContextFiles` is `true` (default), AGENTS.md files load as shared context before agent instructions, which improves KV cache prefix hits.

### Watchdog

The watchdog stops agents that hang. Two independent checks, both default 45 minutes, `0` disables:

- `toolTimeoutMinutes`: a single tool call running longer than this stops the agent.
- `idleTimeoutMinutes`: no activity (tool events or streamed response text) for this long stops the agent.

The watchdog notifies the main session on a kill so it can act accordingly.

### Output transcripts

Output transcripts are disabled by default. Enable them globally via the `outputTranscript` config option or per-agent via the `output_transcript` frontmatter field. When enabled, the transcript streams to `/tmp/pi-agent-outputs/<agentId>.log` (append-only, `tail -f` friendly) and the widget shows the `tail -f` line. Logs and completed results survive on disk even if a session reload (`/reload`, extension reload) kills running agents.
